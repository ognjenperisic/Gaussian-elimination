# Gaussian-elimination

Gaussian elimination is a method for solving matrix equations of the form

Ax=b. 

The full description is given in

My implementation is pure CPP code. There is also a version of the code that randomly generates a set of equations with up to 10 variables. I used that as a benchmarking tool.
